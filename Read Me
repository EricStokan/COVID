This is my first Git Hub repository, so I will make a lot of mistakes.  Please feel free to let me know which need correcting.  
In this file, I will include my R markdown file which pulls COVID-19 data from two sources: Johns Hopkins County API and Covidtracking.com

I do some work to include state-level policy actions to mitigate the spread of the virus (such as stay at home policies).  I will update
with information regarding when those policies were lifted.  I will supplement with County-level policies in the future.

My Rmarkdown file is fairly well contained and should pull the sources of information; however, you may need to register with the Hopkins
AWS site for it to work.
